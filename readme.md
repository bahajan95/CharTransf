## PHP Character Migration Web Service (powered by Laravel)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/polaretto/CharTransf.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/polaretto/CharTransf)

The idea of this project is to create a solid tool that makes it possible the migration of the in-game characters between servers and by character dumps in a database-agnostic way. This means that whichever emulation server is being used the tool should in a nearly automatic way understand the database structure and adapt to it.
More to come.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for this tool is not available yet, even though in detail code docs is being costantly written in parallel with the implementation.
